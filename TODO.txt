TODO LIST
I need to examine the connection between tsdemux and xevddec. When using the gst_pipeline_debug.py script, the negotiation process fails to work properly. The xevddec plugin returns incorrect capabilities for establishing the connection with tsdemux, with some parameters being superfluous.
The xeveenc and xevddec plugins are functional and can be used successfully.
I still need to complete the implementation of inserting the LCEVC_video_descriptor() into the transport stream as specified in the T-REC-H.222.0-202308-S!!PDF-E.pdf document. I have just obtained the LCEVC standard draft, which will allow me to extract the necessary information from the NAL units.

Key issues to address:

Fix the capabilities returned by xevddec to improve negotiation with tsdemux
Remove superfluous parameters from the capability negotiation
Implement the LCEVC_video_descriptor() insertion according to H.222.0 standard
Analyze the LCEVC draft for proper NAL unit data extraction
