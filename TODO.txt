TODO LIST
Fix little memory leak

I still need to complete the implementation of inserting the LCEVC_video_descriptor() into the transport stream as specified in the T-REC-H.222.0-202308-S!!PDF-E.pdf document. I have just obtained the LCEVC standard draft, which will allow me to extract the necessary information from the NAL units.

Key issues to address:

Implement the LCEVC_video_descriptor() insertion according to H.222.0 standard
Analyze the LCEVC draft for proper NAL unit data extraction
